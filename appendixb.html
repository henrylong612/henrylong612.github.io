            <h1>Appendix B: Varanasi Tour Roster</h1>


        <p>Below is the roster of our tour group from Varanasi. We nicknamed all the men (besides our tour guide) after the 7 dwarves from Snow White and all the women after the 4 March sisters from Little Women. Muthu and I were the only tour members from America and the only tour members under the age of 40.</p>
